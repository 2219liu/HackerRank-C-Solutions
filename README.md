# 👋 Friendly Reminders

## 📌 Sharing & Credit

- These solutions are MIT-licensed (free to use!), but please keep the original author notes.
- Never share answers to HackerRank’s paid/premium problems here.
- If you adapt someone else’s approach, give them a shoutout in the code comments with a link.

## 📌 Coding Philosophy

We prioritize readability over cleverness:
- ✅ Use standard library functions
- ✅ Name variables like "student_count" instead of "n"
- ✅ Break code into logical chunks
- 🚫 Avoid platform-specific tricks
- 🚫 No magic numbers - use constants explained in the problem

## 🛠️ When Things Break

1.Check if HackerRank updated the problem recently

2.Triple-check your input formatting matches exactly what they want

3.Hunt down any leftover debug print statements

4.Still stuck? File an issue with:
- Problem URL
- Error message screenshot
- What test case failed
